### Sorting Algorithms

This project was created as part of a college course in algorithms, as an assignment to implement and test various sorting algorithms. The project implements a number of popular sorting methods, including insertion sort using binary search, selection sort with simultaneous minimum and maximum search, and cocktail sort, which is a modification of bubble sort. Additionally, it implements iterative merge sort using a queue, and optimized quicksort for linked lists, with different methods of selecting the pivot: as the first element or as a random element.

All algorithms were tested on various input data sets, including sorted, reversed, randomly sorted, and randomly generated integer arrays. Testing was performed using special test classes that measured execution time, number of comparisons, number of element swaps, and also checked whether the algorithm sorted the data correctly and whether the sorting stability was maintained. Test results were then exported to CSV files, allowing analysis of the algorithms' performance depending on the structure of the input data.

The project uses various helper classes, including the abstract `SortingAlgorithm<T>` class, which provides a base for all sorting algorithms, and the `Tester` class, which performs multiple tests, collects results, and calculates statistics. It also uses data structures such as `java.util.LinkedList<T>`, which allows testing algorithms with linked lists. The project provides detailed results that can be used to further analyze and optimize sorting algorithms.
